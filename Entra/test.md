🚀 **Exciting Announcement for U.S. Federal Agencies!** 🚀

We’re thrilled to present the **[M-21-31 Maturity Model Management App](https://github.com/Cyberlorians/M-21-31/tree/main)** – a powerful tool developed to strengthen the cybersecurity posture of federal agencies in response to **[Executive Order M-21-31](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/M-21-31-Improving-the-Federal-Governments-Investigative-and-Remediation-Capabilities-Related-to-Cybersecurity-Incidents.pdf)** and **[EO 14028](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/12/fact-sheet-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/)**. After over a year of dedication and countless after-hours work by our team, we’re excited to release this **early-stage BETA** version!

### Key Highlights:
🔍 **Visibility Across the Incident Lifecycle** – The app centralizes event logging data, offering enhanced visibility, enabling better incident response, and proactive threat mitigation.  
📊 **Event Logging Maturity Levels** – With a focus on continuous improvement, agencies can track their progress towards full compliance across EL0–EL3 levels. Currently, **EL0 Identity mappings** are available in this release.  
🛡️ **Event Logging Maturity** – Stay on top of logging requirements with real-time updates on implementation and maturity.  
⚖️ **Third-Party Mappings Coming Soon** – As we move beyond beta, we’ll be adding additional third-party/non-Microsoft workloads and progressively rolling out more mappings to further enhance the app's flexibility.

### 🚨 **Limited BETA Release:**
At this stage, we are releasing **EL0 Identity mappings** only. Additional mappings and tiers (EL0–EL3) will be rolled out incrementally post-beta. Stay tuned for updates as we expand.
